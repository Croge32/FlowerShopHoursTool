# FlowerShopHoursTool
A code sample of an hours-setting tool for a flower shop. 

This is a UI implementation for a tool that can change hours for a business. Multiple shifts can be added, and shifts cannot overlap.
This was intended to be a very lightweight and simple implementation, so no frameworks were used. JQuery and Bootstrap were the libraries
I utilized.
